# OpenDaylight Energy Management project

The eman (energy Management) project provides an management framework for 
energy aware devices, allowing for measurement and optimization of energy usage.

Based  on open standards from IETF(1) and SCTE (2), eman features 
facilitate the collection of energy data and allow nortbound SDN applications 
to manipulate the network based on energy demands. In future it will also be possible
to control the energy state of manage devices.
