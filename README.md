# OpenDaylight Energy Management project

This project aims to provide an management framework for the
energy data.

Based heavily on open standards [IETF RCF 7326] that have been adapted
for ODL and Yang this feature will facilitate the collection of
energy data and allow nortbound SDN applications to manipulate the
network based on energy demands. In future it may also be possible
to control the energy state of manage devices.
